#Mini Library Bot

	A miniature library I built that houses a Raspberry Pi 2 which will keep track of books through button presses, 
	output messages onto an LCD, power LED's, and send Tweets to a Twitter account @MiniLibBot.

##Code	
	
	The library runs of a simple python script that interfaces with the GPIO pins, and connects to 
	the twitter account. A python LCD library was used from [Matt Hawkins](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/)
	The python code is initiated through a startupscript that runs on boot. 
	Photos of the build process are also in this repo.
